"""
Outliers and ectobeats correction
=================================

This example shows how to detect extra ectobeats, missed and ectobeats from RR
time series using the method proposed by Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) [#]_.

# Two approaches for artefacts correction are proposed:
# * `correct_peaks()` will find and correct artefacts in a boolean peaks
# vector, thus ensuring the length of recording remain constant and corrected
# peaks fit the signal sampling rate. This method is more adapted to
# event-related cardiac activity designs.

# * `correct_rr()` will find and correct artefacts in the RR time series. The
# signal length will possibly change after the interpolation of long, short or
# ectopic beats. This method is more relevant for HRV analyse of long recording
# where the timing of experimental events is not important.
