"""
Outliers and ectobeats detection
================================

This example shows how to detect extra ectobeats, missed and ectobeats from RR
time series using the method proposed by Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) [#]_.

# Artefact detection
# ------------------
# You can visualize the two main subspaces and spot outliers.
# Here we can see that two intervals have been labelled as probable ectobeats
# (left pannel), and a total of 6 datapoints are considered as outliers, being
# too long or too short (right pannel).

plot_subspaces(rr)

#%%
# Plotting
# --------
# We can then plot back the labelled outliers in the RR interval time course

ectobeats, outliers = rr_outliers(rr)
plot_hr(rr.values, kind='linear', outliers=(ectobeats | outliers))
