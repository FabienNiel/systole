Outliers and ectobeats correction
=================================

This example shows how to detect extra ectobeats, missed and ectobeats from RR
time series using the method proposed by Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) [#]_.

    # Two approaches for artefacts correction are proposed:
    # * `correct_peaks()` will find and correct artefacts in a boolean peaks
    # vector, thus ensuring the length of recording remain constant and corrected
    # peaks fit the signal sampling rate. This method is more adapted to
    # event-related cardiac activity designs.

    # * `correct_rr()` will find and correct artefacts in the RR time series. The
    # signal length will possibly change after the interpolation of long, short or
    # ectopic beats. This method is more relevant for HRV analyse of long recording
    # where the timing of experimental events is not important.
    #
    # import numpy as np
    # import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    #
    # rr = rr_artifacts()
    #
    # # Method 1
