"""
Outliers and artefacts detection
================================

This example shows how to detect ectopic, missed, extra, slow and long long
from RR or pulse rate interval time series using the method proposed by
Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019) [#]_.

# Simulate RR time series
# -----------------------
# This function will simulate RR time series containing ectopic, extra, missed,
# long and short artefacts.

# ------------------

#%%
# Time series visualization
# -------------------------
# You can visualize the RR time series. Providing and `artefact` dictionary
# will also highlight the detected artefactsa and outliers. Here, we can see
# that all the simulated artefacts were correctly labelled by the algorythm.

# Subspaces visualization
# -----------------------
# You can visualize the two main subspaces and spot outliers. The left pamel
# plot subspaces that are more sensitive to ectopic beats detection. The right
# panel plot subspaces that will be more sensitive to long or short beats,
# comprizing the extra and missed beats.
